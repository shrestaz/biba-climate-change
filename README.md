    - If using a cloud based Jupyter notebook (for example: Azure or Roskilde University's server), no installation needed.
2. Clone the project. `git clone https://github.com/shrestaz/biba-climate-change.git`
3. Open the file named `Climate change analysis - the ðŸ”¥ topic.ipynb` through Anaconda Jupyter notebook or upload it to the cloud server if using that.
4. VoilÃ .
